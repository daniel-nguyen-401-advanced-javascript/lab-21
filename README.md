## Challenge
    
Your application should implement the same basic functionality, though note that other pieces such as styling, layout, text content, etc. can be completely up to you! Here are the major functionality pieces:

* Header and footer elements with some styling and text
* An increment count button which adds 1 to the current count
* A decrement count button which subtracts 1 from the current count
* A current count display that is initialized at 0 and updates as the count changes

## Approach & Efficiency

- n/a

# API

- n/a
    
## Testing Instructions
    
- Click the Code Sandbox link
- Click the `Minus` and `Plus` buttons to decrement or increment the counter which is initialized at zero
